remember to change job output directory in generic files
possibly change time and mem in generic files for large jobs
works with and without msym and spinflip sym.
current records: with msym and spinflip for AFM in m=0 subspace: 40 spins
		without mysm and without spinflip for transverse ising with field=0.5: ~30 spins
additional output files without msym
stepall_v2: neat!
